# âœ¨ UnScribble

UnScribble is a smart tool that turns messy doodles into nice drawings, photos, and paintings using AI magic.

# ðŸ’¡ How it works 
UnScribble uses a Stable Diffusion based AI model called ControlNet to transform your hand-drawn doodles into photos and sketches.
You can either draw your scribble or upload an image of it, then add a short 1-3 word description, and let ControlNet work its magic.
The AI model is deployed and run on Replicate, scribbles are stored in Cloudinary.
